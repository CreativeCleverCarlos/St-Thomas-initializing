                <h2>Our Belief</h2>
                <p>We believe that God is love, God is good, and God is omnipotent. He is omniscient, omnipresent and that he is the ultimate source of authority in heaven and on earth. He so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish, but may have eternal life. We believe our one God exists eternally in three persons; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>

                <h3>Jesus Christ</h3>
                <p>We believe Jesus Christ is the one and only Son of God, literally God in the flesh, now 100% God and 100% human. We believe he came to earth, born of a virgin,  and lived among us free of sin. Jesus came to be the way, the truth, and the life. He lived, died, was buried, rose again, and ascended back to heaven where he lives making interssions for us. One day he will come again to receive his faithful followers into eternal habiations. </p>

                <h3>The Church</h3>
                <p>The church is the body of Christ on earth and Jesus Christ is the head. It is not simply an organization or instition, but a living organism comprised of obedient believes in the world. It exists for the prise of God's glory. The local church is the expression an any locality of the church. It is composed of believers who gather to encourage each other to faithfulness and to worship and serve the Lord God as he provides opportunity. Within the body of Christ there is also diversity expressed by gifts given to each believer by God. These spritual gifts nable a believer to function especially well in areas of service for the good of the body; thus, there are no superiors or inferiors in the body of Chrit.</p>

                <h3>Worship</h3>
                <p>We gather to worship regularly on the first day of every week, the day on which Jesus Christ was raised from the dead. We assemble to participate togethre in the Lord's Supper, to sing songs,  and hymns in a spiritual acapella. The pray, listen, and read the scriputres aloud publicly. And to teach classes and sermons. We believe we are to be in regular attendance so that we can encourage each other to remain faithful and to grow in love and in good deeds. In short, we look to the new Testamentand historical evidence to see what the 1st centure church believed and praciced, and y extension what the church in any century is to believe and practice</p>
